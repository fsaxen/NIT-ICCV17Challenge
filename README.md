# NIT-ICCV17Chaellenge
This code submission for the ICCV 17 Real Versus Fake Expressed Emotion Challenge provides source code to extract the features and classifiy each video for a given folder.

# 1. System Requirements
Linux (we use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

# 2. Software Requirements
Some parts of the code is written in C++ (with C++14 standard). We used the gcc compiler version (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609.
CMake (we use a CMake build process for this project. We use CMake 3.5.1 but newer versions will be just fine. Download: https://cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.2-Linux-x86_64.sh)
Other parts of the code is written in Matlab. We used matlab version R2015a but newer and earlier versions will probably work just as fine. Octave does not provide some important features.
Finally the labels are generated with automatically generated python code (from matlab). We use python 3.1

cuda 8.0 (download cuda: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads, install help: https://askubuntu.com/questions/799184/how-can-i-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-16-04)
cudnn (download https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn, you need to create an account to be able to download cuddn).

# 3. Necessary C++ Libraries
dlib version 19.4 (download http://dlib.net/files/dlib-19.4.tar.bz2)
opencv version 3.1 or newer (download https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.1.0.zip)

# 4. Make C++ Project
TODO

# 5. Execute C++ main file

# 6. Execute Matlab main file

# 7. Execute automatically generated python code
